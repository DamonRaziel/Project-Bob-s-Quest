Possible solutions.
Misc.

Sort out camera collision layers.
Currently clips through level meshes.
Add new layer consisting of only collision shapes that extend a short way away from mesh faces, and assign as the collision layer
for the camera raycast. 
Requires reworking all layers (as currently all on one).

Sort out enemy movement.
Currently based on an older version of the player script. May be using more processing than needed.
Rewrite code to be more basic.
Requires more knowledge of A.I. movement scripting.

Remake models (General).
Currently placeholders.
Make new models.
Not a technical problem, ony to do with game feel and asset quality.
