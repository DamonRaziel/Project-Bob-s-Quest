Sort out camera collision layers.
Currently clips through level meshes.
Add new layer consisting of only collision shapes that extend a short way away from mesh faces, and assign as the collision layer
for the camera raycast. 
Requires reworking all layers (as currently all on one).

Sort out enemy movement.
Fixed to work with Navmesh when moving, and still using adapted player movement for attacks.
Requires more knowledge of A.I. movement scripting.

Currently placeholders.
Make new models.
Not a technical problem, ony to do with game feel and asset quality.

Make cutscenes.
Created opening cutscene and edited in Blender. Made and edited videos for tutorials.

Player now gains experience points and levels up. 
Experience points generate upgrade points which can be used to upgrade character attributes.
