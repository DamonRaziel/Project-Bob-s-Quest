Extra details if needed.
Possible solutions.
Misc.

Sort out camera collision layers.
Currently clips through level meshes.
Add new layer consisting of only collision shapes that extend a short way away from mesh faces, and assign as the collision layer
for the camera raycast. 
Requires reworking all layers (as currently all on one).

Sort out enemy movement.
Currently based on an older version of the player script. May be using more processing than needed.
Rewrite code to be more basic.
Requires more knowledge of A.I. movement scripting.

Remake models (General).
Currently placeholders.
Make new models.
Not a technical problem, ony to do with game feel and asset quality.

Make cutscenes.
Currently only rolling and fixed texts to explain things.
Create cutscenes with animations in Blender, add camera and camera animation paths in Godot.
Or create cutscenes entirely inBlender and edit together as video for import in Godot.

Add experience points and level ups.
Currently only point system and equipment determines power levels.
Add in experience points in a similar manner to points system, but at certain amounts add levels to the player.
Allow player to increase certain attributes when they attain a new level.
