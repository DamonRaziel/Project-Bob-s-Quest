# Project-Bob-s-Quest
Project Bob's Quest files. Project Bob's Quest was built to test my abilities and see what I could learn. It is still a work in progress, and can be used as a base for various mechanics.

Project Bob's Quest is designed to be a 3D action/adventure/platform/RPG game. At present it does not have the RPG element as there is no experience and levels yet.

Project Bob's Quest was made combining aspects from a number of other projects (which will be credited and linked soon), such as the inventory and camera controls, the Godot demo templates, and some problem-solving of my own to figure out how things could be done.
It is still a work in progress, as I learn new ways to do new things, but thought I would upload it in case it is useful for anyone else, or if someone has other ideas for how I could implement things.

Released under same MIT licence as Godot Game Engine.
