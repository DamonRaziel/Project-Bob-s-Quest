# Project-Bob-s-Quest
Project Bob's Quest files. Project Bob's Quest was built to test my abilities and see what I could learn. It is still a work in progress, and can be used as a base for various mechanics.

Project Bob's Quest is designed to be a 3D action/adventure/platform/RPG game. At present it does not have the RPG element as there is no experience and levels yet.

Project Bob's Quest was made combining aspects from a number of other projects (which will be credited and linked soon), such as the inventory and camera controls, the Godot demo templates, and some problem-solving of my own to figure out how things could be done.
It is still a work in progress, as I learn new ways to do new things, but thought I would upload it in case it is useful for anyone else, or if someone has other ideas for how I could implement things.

If you build the project for execution from desktop, you still need to copy across the "Databa_Items.json" file, and place it in a folder called "Database" (see folder structure diagram below). I have only tested this on Windows 10 so far, and I am unsure why this needs to be fixed afterwards (I have tried using the Godot project build setting to include json files in the build, but this does not seem to fix it).
